# Ultralearning Principles for ML Engineering

## 1. Metalearning
Before diving in, research how ML engineering is best learned and what the most important sub-skills are. Map out the concepts, facts, and procedures you need to master, and identify the most effective resources and learning methods used by successful practitioners.

**My Notes:**
1. Why you're learning. What's your goal? Is it to get an outcome? Or learning something just because you think it would be fulfilling?
   - The outcome is to do something fulfilling that also makes me a lot of money, especially in the long term.
2. Determine how knowledge in the field is structured. Brainstorm a long list of concepts, facts, and procedures.
3. Underline the concepts, facts, and procedures you think will be the hardest to learn.
4. Answer how you're going to learn something. He recommends two methods, the benchmark method and the include/exclude method. He says you should spend 5-10% your total learning time creating your learning plan. For me, that could be about 20 hours.
   - **Benchmark method**: Look at how other people learn this stuff. Like how universities or courses teach stuff. Or what people online say is the best way to learn it.
   - **Include/exclude method**: Modify the benchmark method you researched about so it suits your goal better. Pick stuff you will focus on more, and stuff you will focus on less.

## 2. Focus
Sustained concentration is essential when working through complex mathematical concepts, debugging models, or understanding dense research papers. Develop rituals to minimize distractions and build your ability to engage in deep work sessions.

## 3. Directness
Learn ML engineering by actually building ML systems, not just watching tutorials or reading textbooks. Work on real projects, contribute to open-source ML libraries, and solve actual problems rather than endlessly preparing to start.

**My Notes:**
Instead of studying theory, actually do the thing that people in industry do. For example I should use the exact software's that company's use so it's clear I will be a valuable team member from day one, without a lengthy training.

## 4. Drill
Identify your weakest areas—whether it's linear algebra, probability theory, or distributed systems—and isolate them for focused practice. Attack these bottlenecks directly with targeted exercises rather than hoping they improve through general study.

**My Notes:**
Find the sub-skills that are constraining your overall ability. You can design drills or you just do one part of the process. For example, if I want to get better at AI code review, then I could use Greptile on my agent-organism project.

## 5. Retrieval
Test yourself frequently by implementing algorithms from scratch without referencing code, or by explaining concepts aloud. Active recall strengthens memory far more than passive re-reading of documentation or notes.

**My Notes:**
It is better for learning to have to recall stuff from memory than when given hints, and given hints is better than multiple choice questions. Even though much can be looked up online, you have to know that something exists in order to eventually use it. That's why some memorization is still useful. Even taking a quiz before you learn a topic helps you learn it faster later. Then checking if the thing you recalled was good.

## 6. Feedback
Seek honest critique of your code, models, and understanding from mentors, code reviews, and competition leaderboards. Learn to separate useful signal from noise and use criticism as fuel for rapid improvement.

## 7. Retention
Use spaced repetition systems for key formulas, APIs, and concepts that you need to retain long-term. Build habits like regular review and active use of knowledge to prevent skills from decaying.

## 8. Intuition
Don't just memorize solutions—develop deep understanding by asking "why" repeatedly and working through proofs and derivations. True intuition comes from struggling with hard problems yourself rather than immediately looking up answers.

**My Notes:**
Basically just use Feynman technique of explaining stuff as if teaching it to someone. Or use technique where you write a magazine article effectively making a complex topic obvious to average people.

## 9. Experimentation
Once you have fundamentals, branch out beyond tutorials into novel architectures, unconventional approaches, and your own research questions. Push beyond your comfort zone to discover your unique style and contributions to the field.
