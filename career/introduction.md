# Mentor Casey's advice

To give you a little preview, if I were you, chasing a specific salary, and a specific field, I would identify companies who meet those compensation ranges on sites like levels.fyi that have roles in your field (here's their data science levels:
https://www.levels.fyi/?jobFamily=data-scientist&tab=levels)

It's going to be much easier to get a job at a smaller startup/company than a unicorn like anthropic or openai, but I would probably chase those at this point as I think those salaries can get pretty wild, and I think you're less likely to get laid off there in the short term. You could look at their internship/entry level  job descriptions and see what skills and frameworks they list and pursue those.

You could also check out sites like [hellointerview.com](http://hellointerview.com/) for interview prep but you'll probably want to find one more aimed at DS than CS (unless you're pursuing CS).

Did you get any DS coops? We can also just chat on Sat

# My target income

 So I’ll say my target is $270k/yr.
