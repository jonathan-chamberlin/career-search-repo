## 🚫 What I'm NOT Spending Time On

- DS (ML) research track — requires PhD, not targeting this for first job
- NLP and Computer Vision as standalone study — not interested, low overlap with targets
- Mathematical proofs and derivations — understand intuition, don't derive
- TensorFlow and JAX — go deep on PyTorch only
- C++ and CUDA — light exposure only, 10-20 hours total
- Heavy Kubernetes / MLOps — learn Docker and simple deployment, skip deep K8s
- Video lectures and courses — use AI as tutor instead
- Textbooks cover-to-cover — use AI summaries, only open books when AI isn't clear enough
