# Rules

These come from practitioners who already have the jobs I want. Follow them exactly.

1. **Never cold apply.** Always get a referral first. Employees get paid for successful referrals — you're not just asking for a favor. (Sajjaad, $220k Amazon)
2. **Learn top-down, not bottom-up.** Start with a project. Hit a wall. Learn exactly what you need to get past it. Never watch 40 hours of lectures before building. (Gabriel, OpenAI)
3. **Every project ships as a live demo with a link.** You should be able to send someone a URL. A good demo communicates that you understand coding. (Gabriel, OpenAI)
4. **Recursive gap filling.** When AI writes code, go line by line through the core ML logic. When something is vague ("this helps the algorithm learn faster"), ask "what do you mean" recursively until you truly understand. Then explain it back to AI until it confirms you get it. (Gabriel, OpenAI)
5. **Active recall weekly.** A week after writing code, explain it from memory. If you can't, you were vibe coding. Get a refresher. (Victor, TikTok MLE)
6. **System design > LeetCode.** Ray Fu uses system design every day at work. He never uses LeetCode knowledge except the meta-skill of problem-solving. Both matter, but system design matters more. (Ray Fu)
7. **Reach out to engineers and hiring managers, not recruiters.** Recruiters aren't technical and go with safe bets. Engineers can look at your demo and actually evaluate you. (Gabriel, OpenAI)
8. **Document everything you build and its impact.** At the end of the year this is how you get promoted. (Ray Fu)
9. **Phone in another room during learning blocks.** Distraction/procrastination is the #1 obstacle.
10. **Track daily in Notion.** Log what you worked on and how many hours. Weekly review on Sundays to check if you're hitting 14 hrs/week.
11. **Mon-Tue code is yours.** No Claude Code, no Copilot, no AI-generated code on raw coding days. Claude web /professor-mode only. If you can't build it without AI seeing your code, you don't understand it yet.
