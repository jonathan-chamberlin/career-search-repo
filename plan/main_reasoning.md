# 🧠💡 Reasoning

## 🎯 Goal

Land a spring 2027 co-op/internship as an ML Engineer, Data Scientist, or AI Engineer at a top-tier company (Meta, Google, Amazon, OpenAI, Anthropic, Airbnb, Palantir, Scale AI, Databricks etc.). Build toward $270k/year total comp by May 2029.

## 🏢 Target Roles

1. Machine Learning Engineer
2. ML Engineer (Recommendation Systems)
3. Data Scientist (Consumer)
4. AI Engineer (Applied / Forward Deployed)

## 🪨 Philosophy

Fundamentals first. AI as multiplier, not crutch.

**Who survives when AI automates 70% of coding?** Not the fastest typers. Not the people who vibe coded. The people who understand systems deeply, can reason about tradeoffs, can debug when abstraction breaks, and can design architectures.

**The internal conflict is real.** Deep builder (durable skill, interview strength, slower visible progress) vs. AI orchestrator (rapid output, early monetization, shallow foundation risk). The best long-term position requires hybridization — and this plan does that every single week.

**The deepest distortion:** Believing elite trajectory requires constant acceleration. But compounding skill often requires strategic patience. Optimizing for rate-of-visible-output instead of rate-of-foundational-growth is a subtle but powerful mistake. The false dichotomy + urgency combo causes shallow oscillation between paths, burnout, and chronic comparison anxiety.

**Understanding fundamentals does not make you worse at using AI. It makes you better.** Better at prompting correctly, evaluating outputs, detecting hallucinations, debugging broken abstractions, and designing systems rather than scripts. Businesses don't want people who "use AI." They want people who know what to build, know if it works, know when it's wrong, and know how to fix it. AI amplifies judgment. It does not replace judgment.

**Fundamentals compound. AI tools change every 6-18 months.** One is slow-moving bedrock. One is fast-moving surface water. The optimal strategy in uncertain environments is to maximize optionality. Depth increases optionality. Surface-level speed narrows it.

**Orchestrators without depth become middle managers. Orchestrators with depth become founders and architects.**

**The slow ramp-up is discipline, not cowardice.** Slow ramp-up leads to nonlinear acceleration later. Fast ramp-up leads to plateau risk later. You graduate in 2027. The market will change multiple times before then and reprice AI skills several times. Reacting to current surface volatility as if it's structural destiny is a forecasting distortion.
