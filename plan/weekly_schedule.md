# 📅⏰ Weekly Schedule

14 hours/week. Every week. No exceptions.

| Day | Hours | Focus | Method |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|
| Monday | 2 hrs | Project — raw coding | Claude web /professor-mode only (no codebase access) |
| Tuesday | 2 hrs | Project — raw coding | Claude web /professor-mode only (no codebase access) |
| Wednesday | 2 hrs | Project — same project, with AI | Claude Code (full codebase access) |
| Thursday | 2 hrs | Project — same project, with AI | Claude Code (full codebase access) |
| Friday | 2 hrs | Networking / posting | X, LinkedIn, GitHub |
| Saturday | 2 hrs | LeetCode / HackerRank / DSA | Solo problem solving |
| Sunday | 2 hrs | Catch-up | Any previous session I didn't finish |

**Mon-Tue (raw coding):** You write every line. Claude web with /professor-mode is your tutor — it explains concepts, asks guiding questions, and checks your understanding, but it cannot see your code or generate solutions. This builds the debugging muscle, the "understand systems deeply" skill that survives layoffs.

**Wed-Thu (AI-augmented):** Same project, now with Claude Code. Refactor, extend, add tests, improve architecture. Go line by line through any AI-generated code. Recursive gap filling on anything unclear. This builds the orchestrator skill — using AI as a multiplier on top of a foundation you actually understand.

**Friday (networking/posting):** Post 2x/week on X and LinkedIn about what you're building. Send connection requests and DMs to engineers and hiring managers at target companies. Engage with ML/AI communities. This builds your network before you need it — referrals are how you get interviews, not cold applications.

**Saturday (DSA):** Solo LeetCode and HackerRank problems. Start with easy/medium, progress to medium/hard. Focus on arrays, hashmaps, trees, graphs, dynamic programming. This builds the problem-solving muscle that gets you past online assessments and technical screens.

**Sunday (catch-up):** Finish whatever didn't get done during the week. If everything's done, use it for extra project work or review. This buffer keeps you at 14 hours even when life gets in the way.

## ⏱️ Time Allocation

| Activity | % | Hrs/week |
|----------|---|----------|
| Project (raw coding) | 29% | 4 |
| Project (with AI) | 29% | 4 |
| Networking / posting | 14% | 2 |
| LeetCode / HackerRank / DSA | 14% | 2 |
| Catch-up buffer | 14% | 2 |

## 📊 Lag Metrics

Track every week. Weekly execution score = (metrics hit / 6) x 100%. 85%+ = on track. Below 65% for 2 weeks = diagnose what's going wrong.

1. Hours on raw coding (target: 4)
2. Hours on AI-augmented coding (target: 4)
3. Hours on networking/posting (target: 2)
4. Hours on LeetCode/HackerRank/DSA (target: 2)
5. Outreach messages sent — DMs, connection requests, coffee chat asks (target: 2)
6. Active recall pass/fail — could you explain last week's code from memory? (target: pass)
