# 🏗️⚡ Phase 2 (Aug-Sep) PREP

Get interview-ready. Reach out to EVERYONE in the referral list. Start mock interviews. Polish demos. System design intensive.

## Mon-Tue — Raw Coding: Interview Prep + Polish
- System design practice: 1 full design exercise per week in Excalidraw ("design Netflix recommendations," "design a URL shortener," "design a real-time chat app"). Cover scalability, availability, reliability, CAP theorem.
- Practice explaining both projects as if in an interview — time yourself, 3-5 minutes per project. Include: problem, approach, architecture, tradeoffs, results, what you'd do differently.
- Practice behavioral stories tied to company values (Amazon: customer obsession. Google: impact at scale. Meta: move fast.)
- Start a third project or improve existing ones (add features, improve performance, add tests, polish demos)

## Wed-Thu — AI-Augmented: Polish + Mock Prep
- Active GitHub commits during this period show you're still building while applying
- Fix anything that needs improvement in demos
- Mock interviews with Casey, Griffin, Marco every 2 weeks
- Practice company-specific question types: Amazon (leadership principles + system design), Google (LeetCode + system design), Meta (LeetCode + system design + behavioral), OpenAI (technical depth + LeetCode)
- Practice explaining technical concepts to non-technical friends (Maddy Zhang's advice) — this directly preps for behavioral rounds where you explain your projects to non-ML interviewers

## Friday — Networking (REFERRAL PUSH)
- **This is the most important networking period of the entire plan.**
- Reach out to ALL people in the referral list for real conversations: Taylor (Google Cloud), Casey Brown, Olivia Gagan (Fidelity), Nishanth (Citadel), Greg Schafer (Scale.ai), Marco, Griffin, Liam Kaufman, Mario, Jonathan Parra, Jai Senthil Kumar, Sebastian Sepulveda
- Show them your portfolio site and demos. At the end of each conversation, ask: "Would you be down to give me a referral for the upcoming spring co-op cycle?"
- Continue posting 2x/week on LinkedIn, X, and GitHub about your interview prep journey
- Apply to 1-2 companies you don't care about for real interview reps — this is practice, not the real push (Prime's advice)

## Saturday — LeetCode / HackerRank / DSA
- Ramp up to 4-5 problems per session
- Focus on medium problems and common patterns: dynamic programming, graph problems, tree traversals, string manipulation
- Goal is pattern recognition: see a problem, know which approach to use

## Sunday — Catch-up Buffer

## Milestones (must be true before Phase 3)

- Have done at least 4 mock interviews (behavioral + technical)
- Can explain both projects fluently in 3-5 minutes each without notes

- Have reached out to ALL people on the referral list
- Have at least 3 confirmed referrals lined up for applications
- Have prepared 3-4 behavioral stories tied to target company values
