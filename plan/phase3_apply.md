# 📨🎯 Phase 3 (Oct-Jan) APPLY + SECURE OFFER

Apply to spring 2027 co-ops with referrals. Interview. Get offers. Prepare to hit the ground running on day 1.

## Mon-Tue — Raw Coding: Drill Weak Areas
- Keep building or improving projects between interviews. Active GitHub commits show you're still working.
- Drill weak areas exposed by real interviews — if system design was weak, do more Excalidraw. If LeetCode was weak, target that pattern.
- After every interview, write down what went well and what you struggled with. Fix the weak spots immediately.

## Wed-Thu — AI-Augmented: Polish + Prep
- Fix anything that came up during interviews ("we noticed your demo doesn't handle X"). Polish demos.
- Continue mock interviews with Casey, Griffin, Marco — keep drilling weak areas exposed by real interviews
- Once offer accepted: ask recruiter to connect you with your future manager. Get on a 1-on-1 call to learn what you'll work on and what tools/frameworks the team uses (Sajjaad's advice).
- If the team uses unfamiliar tools (Spark, Kafka, internal frameworks), build a small project with it — just enough to not be lost on day 1
- Read about the company's principles, mission, and recent technical blog posts. Understand what your team ships and how they measure success (Maddy Zhang's advice).

## Friday — Networking + Applications
- Apply to target companies WITH referrals: Amazon, Meta, Google, Uber, OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Scale.ai, Airbnb, Intuit, Adobe, LinkedIn
- Apply to no more than 2 roles per company (Amazon cooldown is 6-24 months if you bomb one)
- Message the specific recruiter assigned to each role on LinkedIn — link the role, explain your qualifications (Yvonne's advice)
- Ask recruiters if the company has resources to help you pass the online assessment
- Use Northeastern career services for resume review and interview prep
- Check NUWorks for spring 2027 co-op postings
- Post 2x/week on LinkedIn and X about your application journey
- Contribute to 1-2 open source ML projects (PyTorch, Hugging Face, or Ray) — fix bugs, engage with maintainers on Discord. This builds real codebase experience (reading other people's code, code review, debugging) and looks great on a resume (Maddy Zhang's advice re: Google Summer of Code)
- Only negotiate salary with a competing offer for internships (Sajjaad's advice)
- Thank everyone who gave you referrals, regardless of outcome. Update them on where you landed. These relationships matter for the rest of your career.
- Post about landing the co-op on LinkedIn and X — this closes the loop on the "building in public" story

## Saturday — LeetCode / HackerRank / DSA
- Maintain sharpness. Continue medium problems, attempt 1-2 hard problems per week.
- Focus on problems similar to what you've seen in real interviews
- Once offer is secured: maintenance mode. 2-3 problems to stay sharp.

## Sunday — Catch-up Buffer

## Milestones (end of plan)

- Have applied to at least 8 target companies with referrals
- Have completed at least 4 real interviews
- Have written post-interview notes for every interview identifying weak areas
- Have a system for tracking application status (applied, phone screen, onsite, offer, rejected)
- HackerRank/LeetCode total: at least 50 medium + 5 hard problems completed
- Have made at least 1 meaningful open source contribution (merged PR or active engagement with maintainers)
- Have accepted a co-op/internship offer for spring 2027
- Have spoken with future manager and know what team/tools to expect
- Have studied any unfamiliar tools the team uses
- Have read the company's engineering blog and understand the team's domain
- Start co-op in January 2027
- On day 1: document everything you build and its impact from the start — this is how you get a return offer or promotion (Ray Fu's advice)
- Ask your manager to review your code on calls and show appreciation for every comment — this gets you more and better feedback (Gabriel's advice)
