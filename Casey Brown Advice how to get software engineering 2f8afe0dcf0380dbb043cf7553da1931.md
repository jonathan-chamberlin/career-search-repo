- Casey’s initial message
    
    To give you a little preview, if I were you, chasing a specific salary, and a specific field, I would identify companies who meet those compensation ranges on sites like levels.fyi that have roles in your field (here's their data science levels:
    [https://www.levels.fyi/?jobFamily=data-scientist&tab=levels](https://www.levels.fyi/?jobFamily=data-scientist&tab=levels))
    
    It's going to be much easier to get a job at a smaller startup/company than a unicorn like anthropic or openai, but I would probably chase those at this point as I think those salaries can get pretty wild, and I think you're less likely to get laid off there in the short term. You could look at their internship/entry level  job descriptions and see what skills and frameworks they list and pursue those.
    
    You could also check out sites like [hellointerview.com](http://hellointerview.com/) for interview prep but you'll probably want to find one more aimed at DS than CS (unless you're pursuing CS).
    
    Did you get any DS coops? We can also just chat on Sat

- How much money do I want to make? If I want to save $50,000 for a bimax in 5 months, I’d need to make $267k/yr gross. **So I’ll say my target is $270k/yr.**
    1. If my living expenses are 30% my gross income, and I want to save $50,000 as fast as possible, how much would i need to make (y value) to save that much in x months. Increment from values of 1,2,3,...24.
    2. This is to save for a bimax surgery
    
    Got it — concise, no fluff.
    
    ### Assumptions
    
    - Taxes: **25% of gross**
    - Living expenses: **30% of gross**
    - Savings rate: **45% of gross**
    - Goal: **$50,000 saved**
    - (y) = **annual gross income**
    - (x) = **months**
    
    ### Formula
    
    [
    
    y = \frac{50{,}000 \times 12}{0.45 \times x}
    
    ]
    
    ### Required Annual Gross Income by Month
    
    | Months (x) | Required Income (y) |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1 | $1,333,333 |
    | 2 | $666,667 |
    | 3 | $444,444 |
    | 4 | $333,333 |
    | 5 | $266,667 |
    | 6 | $222,222 |
    | 7 | $190,476 |
    | 8 | $166,667 |
    | 9 | $148,148 |
    | 10 | $133,333 |
    | 11 | $121,212 |
    | 12 | $111,111 |
    
    **Why this matters:**
    
    With a 45% savings rate, time is the dominant lever. Cutting the timeline below 6 months forces income into commission / spike territory fast.

# ⭐Takeaways:

- It is a very hard time for juniors because AI has replaced most of the work juniors would do.
- Most important #1 priority is for me to get job experience via and internship or coop. These are important because either they could hire you full time later, and/or get you a great reference, and the network you build could help you get another job if needed. Casey, as a hiring manager, would always focus on past experience. It would make him confident they could work in an egineering environment and that they need less training.
- The best roles to pick are ones that won’t be obsolete for a long time. Bad choices are customer service and call centers. Good choices are highly technical roles.
- It’s better to work for a public company than a private one because your stock options (aka RSU) are tied to real cash, whereas for private companies who haven’t IPOed or gotten acquired yet the money is less real.
- Working at a company with a big name is optimal because it gives you a great reputation for the rest of your career, like FAANG or MANGO.
- Working at an AI company is better than a non-AI company because you still need humans in the loop to improve them.
- First decide how much money you want to make, then find job titles on [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) where you make that much.
- Once you identify job roles you want to target, search “reddit {job_title}” (examples: *“reddit cs career advice” “reddit data science career advice” “reddit learn data science” “reddit ask data science (ex: data science projecs that helped land a job internship” ).* Oftentimes these will have info about what skills to learn, and what questions are asked in the interviews for the companies you’re interested in. This is also how you determine how much time to spend solving problem with AI vs. writing and understanding code. Maybe a company mostly wants you to solve problems with AI, or maybe they want your to mostly understand the code line by line. Even if you aren’t applying yet, you should still look at these to see how deeply you need to look at these topics. In the industry right now it’s not about memorization, it’s more about understanding the concepts and how to apply it.
- You have to be a top performer. Like top 10% DS grad. Grind now, because your decision making compounds.
- To get an internship, go to every Khoury job fair and employer panel. Also consult the student employement center. Some of Casey’s friends studied really hard for interviews, got a job at Amazon or Inuit, and got setup for life.
- Perception is important for hiring. Have someone in HR (Olivia Gagan) google me and tell me if there are any red flags when she searches me on google.
- In industry, DS would develop a model or workflow. Usually SQL or Python based using numpy or pytorch and deep learning libraries. Then the data engineers would operatioalize it so it ran reliabily an Met SLAs that were written up for it.

- Raw notes
    
    ~~I’m looking to figure out what skills I should learn to get a high paying tech job. I did what you suggested on levels fyi and the ones that sound interesting are **Machine Learning Engineer, Analytics Engineer, Data Engineer, AI Engineer.**~~ 
    
    ~~He said the descisions i make now are going to compound over time. If i do things well, in 10 years i’ll be in a really good position. It’s worth working now. Grind hard. I’ll get lots of rejections but that’s okay. Lean a lot more on career fiars and employer panels more than cold apps. There are people who could help me in the career center or something.~~
    
    ~~What’s your job role?~~
    
    ~~How much does you spend writing code yourself, vs using something like claude code or cursor, vs doing code review? It boils down to what I need to know on my interview. If the ocmpnay wants to hire people who write code and understand it, get good at that. But every company has rounds with AI interviews.~~
    
    ~~^ Start on these reddits to determine whaet the companies want me to learn.~~
    
    ~~everyone is impacted. some are completly obselete.~~ 
    
    ~~you have to be a top performer.~~
    
    ~~Choose a job or role that won’t be immedeitly obselete. Things chatbots can replace, and call centers, and customer service is obselete. But technical career with technical degree won’t go away anytime soon. AI is taking away junior level work. AI isn’t perfect yet.~~
    
    Casey uses AI everyday. He still has to correct it most of the time by asking it to redo things.
    
    ~~He says i should work at AI based company because you need humans in the loop to improve the systems. If you look at the economy, AI startups and unicorns are being valued crazy high. RSUs or actual stock is good because. Joining a public company is better than private because your RSU is actually real. Plus yo uusually get a really low strike price. So public company their stock ties to real dollars. Meta, reddit, etc.~~
    
    ~~Casey has spent entire career working at private companies. But if he did it again he would go for public companies.~~
    
    ~~Casey used to run a data engineering team. He didn’t look at DS guys persay, he looked at other stuff. Like people who had stuff on their resume that gave them confidence they could operate in engineering environemnts.~~
    
    ~~His concern as a hiring manager, getting an internship or experience in data science field would be important for me. He doesn’t think there has been a tougher time since after the web bubble crashed to get an internship. Right now there is a very heavy applicant pool. He says I should bust my butt to get some professional experience at a company in the DS field. Getting references or people I could lean on to get another job. Its about the community.~~
    
    ~~He said I MUST do a coop or internship #1. If i had to take an unpaid internship, i should do that too. Also good reference or get that company to hire you full time later. At NEU i can get my resume in front of people must more easily.~~
    
    ~~As a hiring manager he was always focused on people with hard experience. Because you save them getting up to speed.~~
    
    ~~To get that coop / internship, go to every career fair, employer panel. He got all his coops through northeastern and attending those events. His friends studied for interviews a ton and went to great companies and made a ton of money. Casey did all his coops in boston. It’s better to set yourself up at a big company like Amazon or Inuit.~~
    
    ~~There’s lots of subreddits and dedicated websites saying what interview questions have been asked at a company recently. Even if you aren’t applying yet, you should still look at these to see how deeply you need to look at these topics. Right now it’s not about memorization, it’s more about understanding the concepts and how to apply it. This will pay dividends.~~
    
    ~~I need to be top 10% entry level role.~~ 
    
    ~~If i get a job at FAANG or MANGO, if I break into that, I set myself up for a long time.~~
    
    ~~At this point, just get exerpience at a coop internship.~~
    
    ~~Perception. People are going to google you.~~
    
    ~~If he was trying to find a girlfriend, he would like my profile. Casey knows people who the company found out someone doing that looks bad online, and they got rejected or fired.~~ 
    
    - [ ]  ~~Ask Olivia Gagan in HR to google my name, and looo at my insta if there are any red flags to being hired.~~
