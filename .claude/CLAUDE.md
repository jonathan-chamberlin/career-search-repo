# Career Search — Tech Job Transition Planning

## Purpose
Job search planning and daily activity tracking for a career transition into tech (ML Engineering, Data Science, Analytics Engineering, AI Engineering).

## Key Files
- `plan.md` — 5-phase technical roadmap with weekly breakdown (26KB — read specific sections, not the whole file)
- `what-i-did-today.md` — Daily progress log (14KB — append to end, don't read the whole file)
- `career/introduction.md` — Target roles, interests, goals
- `career/job_listings.xlsx` — Tracked job opportunities

## Writing Style
Be extremely concrete and direct. Explain why methods work and why they don't. Focus on actionable advice tied to specific target roles.

## What NOT to Read
- Don't read `plan.md` or `what-i-did-today.md` in full — they're large. Read specific sections or append to the end.
- Don't read `ultralearning/` directory upfront — reference specific files when needed.
