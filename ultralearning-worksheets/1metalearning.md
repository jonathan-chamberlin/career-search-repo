# Metalearning Worksheet: Learning How to Learn ML Engineering

*"Before diving in, research how ML engineering is best learned and what the most important sub-skills are."*

**Time Investment:** Spend 5-10% of your total learning time on metalearning. For a 400-hour learning project, that's ~20-40 hours upfront.

**Date Started:** _______________
**Date Completed:** _______________

## Part 1: WHY - Clarifying Your Motivation

Understanding your motivation helps you prioritize what to learn and stay committed when things get hard.

### 1.1 Instrumental vs. Intrinsic Motivation

**Question:** Are you learning ML engineering primarily for an outcome (instrumental) or for the joy of learning itself (intrinsic)?

- [] Primarily instrumental (career, money, specific job)
- [ ] Primarily intrinsic (fascination with the field)
- [X] Both equally

**Your answer (explain):**
- ultimately i want to make $270k/year because this wod let me realistically save $50,000 for a bimax surgery in only 5 months.

### 1.2 Define Your Concrete Goal

**Question:** What specific outcome do you want? Be as precise as possible.

- **Job title you want:**
  -ML Engineer or Data Scientist (ML or Consumer)
- **Company type (startup/FAANG/research lab):**
  -Ultimately I want to work at a FANNG or top tier public company, like Meta, Google, Apple, Netflix, OpnAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, Airbnb, Intuit, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe, Linkedin, etc.
- **Salary range target:**
  - Eventually I want to hit $270k/year total comp.
- **Location/remote preference:**
  - Ideally San Francisco, LA, or remote.
- **Timeline to achieve this:**
  - By 1 year after graduation, or May 2029.

### 1.3 Why This Path?

**Question:** Why ML engineering or Data Science (ML or Consumer) specifically, rather than other tech roles?
- Because I already built 2 machine learning projects, agent-organism and lunar-lander, and had lots of fun making them. Additionally, for years I have really enjoyed tracking data. 

Data engineering, VR / immersive tech don't sound too interesting. AI engineering seems like something I would get good at naturally because I could integrate stuff to improve the products and systems I create. 

**Question:** What would you do if ML engineering jobs disappeared tomorrow?
- I would do analytics engineering. I could get really good at that since I've really enjoyed tracking and working with data my whole life. But it pays less than the ML engineering or DS roles.

*Suggestion: If your answer reveals a deeper interest (e.g., "I'd still want to build intelligent systems"), note that—it reveals your true motivation.*

## Part 2: WHAT - Mapping Knowledge Structure

## Part 3: HOW - Research Learning Methods

### 3.1 The Benchmark Method

Research how others successfully learned ML engineering.

#### University Curricula

**Question:** What do top ML programs (Stanford CS229, CMU ML, MIT) teach and in what order?

- **Stanford CS229:**
  -
- **CMU ML:**
  -
- **MIT:**
  -
- **Key takeaways:**
  -

#### Online Courses

**Question:** What are the most recommended courses/resources? (FastAI, Coursera, etc.)

- **Course 1:**
  - Name:
  - What it covers:
  - Recommended by:
  - Your interest (1-5):
- **Course 2:**
  - Name:
  - What it covers:
  - Recommended by:
  - Your interest (1-5):
- **Course 3:**
  - Name:
  - What it covers:
  - Recommended by:
  - Your interest (1-5):
- **Course 4:**
  - Name:
  - What it covers:
  - Recommended by:
  - Your interest (1-5):

#### Practitioner Interviews

**Question:** Find 3-5 ML engineers on LinkedIn/Twitter with jobs you want. What was their path?

- **Person 1:**
  - Name/handle: Ray Fu
  - Current role:
  - Their learning path: He had a friend who he hungout with everyday who already did technical interviews, and they would code together (I could do this with Kenny).
  - Key insights:
    - They said books like Cracking the Coding Interview and Programming Interviews in Python
    - Mock Interviews with People who got the job or hire other people (I could use Casey for this, or Griffin or Marco [ I'd have to find their instas or get their numbers from Matt]).
    - He says the biggest thing is asking people in your network for referals. Remember that employees get paid if they refer someone who gets hired. I could ask Olivia Gagan for a referal, or if there is a software engineer I could get an introduction to to have a coffee chat with. A secondary tactic is going to linkedin, searching 'software engineer' then connecting with as many as possible. 
    - Sending your resumes to application sites doesn't really work because there are 10,000 other people doing the same.
    - Start building and posting about your journey online (I could make a task to post twice per week on linkedin something about what I'm building).
    - People in tech are so nice and want to help new people. Ask people for help.
    - At startups people look for software development, but bigger companies look for your knowledge of problem solving, especially solving data structures and algorithms problems. You don't really need to know how to create an API endpoint, for example, because you could quickly pick that up on the job. 
- you just need to know the principles and be really good at problem-solving. part of that is researching how people have solve problems before.
- one of those problem-solving principles is to not give up. Be stubborn about solving it. Said in a way that's more actionable, if there's a concept that's hard to understand, keep working on it until you do understand it. You can do it.
- this guy also did 300 leet code problems. he said you should work on a problem for 1 to 2 hours, and if you don't get it after two hours, look at the solution, then restart and do the problem by yourself.
- leet code is good for learning data structures and algorithms, and builds your skill of pattern recognition when it comes to deciding what data structure or algorithm you should use to solve a problem.
- think of leet code like th SAT for coding. as a student you never actually do SAT problems in college, but its like an IQ test fo you software knowledge. so i should practice data structure and algorithm problems, an leet code is one option to do that.
