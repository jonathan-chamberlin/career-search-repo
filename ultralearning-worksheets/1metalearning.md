# Metalearning Worksheet: Learning How to Learn ML Engineering

*"Before diving in, research how ML engineering is best learned and what the most important sub-skills are."*

**Time Investment:** Spend 5-10% of your total learning time on metalearning. For a 400-hour learning project, that's ~20-40 hours upfront.

**Date Started:** _______________
**Date Completed:** _______________

## Part 1: WHY - Clarifying Your Motivation

Understanding your motivation helps you prioritize what to learn and stay committed when things get hard.

### 1.1 Instrumental vs. Intrinsic Motivation

**Question:** Are you learning ML engineering primarily for an outcome (instrumental) or for the joy of learning itself (intrinsic)?

- [] Primarily instrumental (career, money, specific job)
- [ ] Primarily intrinsic (fascination with the field)
- [X] Both equally

**Your answer (explain):**
- ultimately i want to make $270k/year because this wod let me realistically save $50,000 for a bimax surgery in only 5 months.

### 1.2 Define Your Concrete Goal

**Question:** What specific outcome do you want? Be as precise as possible.

- **Job title you want:**
  -ML Engineer
- **Company type (startup/FAANG/research lab):**
  -Ultimately I want to work at a FANNG or top tier public company, like Meta, Google, Apple, Netflix, OpnAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, Airbnb, Intuit, etc.
- **Salary range target:**
  - Eventually I want to hit $270k/year total comp.
- **Location/remote preference:**
  - Ideally San Francisco, LA, or remote.
- **Timeline to achieve this:**
  - By 1 year after graduation, or May 2029.

### 1.3 Why This Path?

**Question:** Why ML engineering specifically, rather than other tech roles?
- 

**Question:** What would you do if ML engineering jobs disappeared tomorrow?
-

*Suggestion: If your answer reveals a deeper interest (e.g., "I'd still want to build intelligent systems"), note that—it reveals your true motivation.*

ONCE YOU FINISH FILLING THIS OUT, run this prompt

Okay I finished filling out 1metalearning.md. Now I want you to insert below brainstormed tactics, projects, drills to help me learn the concepts, facts, and procedures in the md file. 

# Insert here

</> 

# Once the ones i want are selected, run this prompt.

Awesome now keeping all those in mind, regenerate ultralearning_swe.md to accurately reflect my preferences, goal, the concepts, facts, and procedures I deemed important, and the principles.
