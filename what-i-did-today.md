- **screentime-blocker**: Shipped Nuclear Block and a full settings redesign — added Nuclear Block with categorized site presets, cooldown timers (20m/18h/36h/5d/14d/30d), auto-unblock on expiry, and "Block Again" dropdown; replaced site textareas with categorized checkbox grids; added gambling, game website, and adult site preset categories; made all settings sections collapsible; fixed Steam blocking (steamwebhelper process detection), app blocking storage bug (focusState key), nuclear block preset rendering, and app checkbox auto-save. Added How to Use page, MV3-compliant install guide, delete all data, blocked app screen, financial penalty toggle, skip productivity check popup, bug report email button, and emoji favicons. Rewrote README with full feature docs and 4 new settings screenshots; aligned privacy policy and CWS listing with current behavior.
- **linkedin-agent**: Built a LinkedIn posting agent from scratch — generates posts with Claude via OpenRouter, publishes with Playwright automation.
- **macros**: Doubled Sleep delays in explorer-hotkey.ahk for reliability; fixed settings.local.json syntax.
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Updated trades.csv with latest Kalshi trade data.

02/16/26 (last checked 01:29):
- **rec-system-folder**: Built conceptual understanding of two-tower recommendation models through guided learning — clarified that towers encode user and book positions in a shared embedding space (not behavioral vs content), understood dot product as the compatibility score, and trained a mental model of how (user, book) interaction pairs nudge vectors together in embedding space. Implemented the data loading pipeline: MyDataset subclassing torch Dataset with iloc-based getitem, and DataLoader instantiation with batch_size=50.
- **screentime-blocker**: Shipped application blocking and settings UX overhaul — added blocking for desktop apps (Steam, Epic Games, Discord, Minecraft) via native host detection and closeApp command, built blocked apps UI section in settings, added 50+ blocked sites and 15+ music/production sites to defaults, replaced per-section save buttons with a floating save banner and unified change detection, implemented auto-save. Fixed timer drift (ms-level tracking), reward grant delay (1s threshold), and chrome.runtime defensive errors.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Translated Professor Akbari's Unit 1 grading feedback into skill improvements — analyzed rubric scores, inline annotations, and written commentary from the B+ paper; added Akbari's 8-criterion rubric and 6 "B+→A" patterns to the engw3309 skill (debatable judgments, how/why depth, push strongest moment, source language precision, analytically specific career application, new-knowledge question); upgraded draft-and-revise self-evaluation from 3-level to 5-level rubric with written commentary (debatability test, how/why check, strongest-moment push), restructured skeptical professor prompt with inline paragraph annotations and structured verdict. Cleaned up browser skill rename and removed local copies of global skills.

02/15/26 (last checked 01:46):
- **screentime-blocker**: Replaced all settings save buttons with auto-save — removed per-section and floating save buttons, added 500ms debounced auto-save triggered by every input change (text fields, textareas, radio buttons, checkboxes), added a "Saved!" toast indicator in the top-right corner, verified end-to-end with Playwright tests (5/5 passing), and finalized Chrome Web Store publish readiness.
- **screentime-blocker**: Shipped 8 features/fixes across parallel git worktrees and merged all to main — added zero-dependency native host (PowerShell+C# replacing Node.js), instant blocking on "Lock In" without page refresh, faster app detection on every native host message, reward expiry instant redirect and pause-reward active tab redirect, "Are you really working?" productivity check popup (configurable timer, per-site tracking, "No" adds site to blocklist), expanded default blocked sites (reddit, instagram, tiktok, twitter, etc.), expanded curated productive apps list (30+ real desktop apps across 9 categories, alphabetically sorted, audited for real Windows processes — removed fake web-only entries), renamed "all-except-blocked" mode to "Always counting" with fix, and settings page now locks instantly when a session starts via runtime messages. Updated GSD skill with "no fabricated data" principle and native messaging worktree rule.
- **screentime-blocker**: Made the codebase AI-agent-friendly — decomposed 680-line god module (background.js) into 8 focused modules via importScripts (session-state, blocking, native-host, backend-api, tab-monitor, reward, session, orchestrator), replaced 100-line if/else message router with a flat handler map, added event subscriber comments to all cross-module broadcasts, extracted popup.js functions from DOMContentLoaded closure to module scope, deduplicated blocked.js screens, named shame thresholds as constants, fixed leaderboard XSS via DOM construction, deleted dead code, removed debug logs. Wrote 28 browser unit tests + 58 Node.js integration tests with full Chrome API mocks. Ran deep automated verification: syntax validation (22/22 pass), cross-module dependency analysis (no duplicates, no undefined symbols), message protocol consistency (10 actions + 4 broadcasts all matched), storage key audit (18 keys, zero typos/dead keys), manifest+HTML wiring check. Updated GSD verification skill with "Deep Automated Testing" section so future verifications are thorough by default.

02/14/26 (last checked 23:40):
- **screentime-blocker**: Installed GSD-OpenCode globally for spec-driven development workflows.
- **claude-global**: Eliminated all permission prompts — replaced ~80 specific permission entries in ~/.claude/settings.json with 12 clean blanket allows (Bash, Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep, Task, TaskOutput, WebSearch, WebFetch, NotebookEdit, MCP IDE tools), so Claude runs fully autonomously across all projects.
- **screentime-blocker**: Made the codebase maintainable and fixed UX rough edges — eliminated `rewardPaused` as a UI state (pausing now immediately banks seconds), fixed reward time rounding bug by converting storage from minutes to seconds, ran a 4-wave GSD refactor extracting 4 shared utility modules (constants, storage, timer, site-utils), replaced 20+ storage callbacks with async/await, deduplicated 9 timer-flush patterns, split monolithic renderUI into focused functions, extracted 200+ lines of shame data into its own file. Post-refactor: "End Session" skips penalty modal when threshold is met, all 5 settings sections lock during work sessions, replaced broken plant GIF with actual houseplant expression, expanded leaderboard test data to 20 users with real names. 23/23 manual tests passing.
- **screentime-blocker**: Prepared for Devpost submission — renamed FocusContract to Brainrot Blocker across 32 files, wrote and polished project_story.md through full draft-and-revise pipeline (factual verification, skeptical professor review, parallel tone review fixing 30+ violations), added "Ways to Improve" section to README, redesigned README with screenshots and moved project docs into overview folder.
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Added paper trading mode to Kalshi weather bot to iterate on the model without spending real money; fixed settlement bug.

0/2/13/26:
- Did Cy2550 homework and ENGW3309 hw. Make it so claude has a skill to generate entity relation diagrams, and take screenshots and insert them into a pdf to submit the assignment. Added a phase to /draft-and-revise skill which lists out all factual claims, and sends different subagents to check all in a token-efficient manner.
- Went to hackbeanpot, a hackathon. Networked with recruiters and brainstormed ideas with my team.

02/12/26 (last checked 15:35):
- **macros + notion-EA + northeastern + career-search (all repos)**: Built an AI-agent-assistance infrastructure layer across all repos — researched 30 tools devs build to help AI coding agents develop better, selected 11, synthesized overlapping items into 8 deliverables, and implemented all 8. Set up ESLint 10 + Prettier in notion-EA and Ruff in northeastern with PostToolUse hooks that auto-lint every file edit and reformat errors as `ERROR [ESLint] file:line:col rule — message` so agents find problems instantly. Created/upgraded CLAUDE.md files in all 4 repos with architecture overviews, key patterns, lint/test commands, and "What NOT to Read" sections for token efficiency (moved 150-line kalshi detail to its own README). Built 3 new global skills: `/repo-map` (generates codebase overview with exports and line counts), `/tdd-workflow` (red-green-refactor with language detection), `/visual-validation` (screenshot + analyze with Playwright). Created 22 seed tests for notion skill (all passing) covering parseDate, validateEnv, mapPageToTask, PRIORITY_MAP. Added structured output format to global CLAUDE.md and a Bash error recovery hook that parses SyntaxError/TypeError/ModuleNotFound into structured `TOOL_ERROR` messages. Created 5 specialized subagents: ahk-expert, node-debugger, academic-writer (global), notion-debugger, api-tester (notion-EA). Set up GitHub Actions for notion-EA (@claude PR mentions + CI test runner). All uncommitted.
- **career-search**: Built out the AI Engineer job category — added 10 real 2025-2026 "AI Engineer" postings to job_listings.xlsx (Palantir, Quora/Poe, Databricks, Scale AI x2, Anthropic, Snowflake, Amazon AGI, Google Cloud AI, ServiceNow), all focused on applied/forward-deployed AI roles that implement AI to solve business problems. Created a synthesized AI Engineer section in skills_aggregate2.md with skill frequency table showing Python and LLMs/GenAI at 10/10, agent development and prompt engineering at 7/10, and customer-facing work at 7/10.
- **career-search**: Made the plan more navigable — split plan.md into 7 focused files under plan/ directory.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Wrote peer review letter for Corinne's Unit 2 rough draft on "Benito Cereno" — evaluated close reading quality, scholar mapping accuracy, and identified gaps (needs tighter integration between close reading and scholarship, needs to cut from 2500 to 1600 words). Ran full draft-and-revise pipeline with parallel tone review and skeptical professor grading. Added 4 tone guidelines (cut "really" padding, paragraph breaks at tonal shifts, acknowledge knowledge gaps, active verbs in feedback). Created engw3309 skill for Advanced Writing assignments, updated markdown-to-pdf with metadata sanity checks and floating point fix, added draft-and-revise auto-run rule to project CLAUDE.md.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Made the meta_ctf skill a complete end-to-end workflow — restructured into 4 phases (setup folder/markdown, solve with screenshots/scripts, handoff answer to user, finalize PDF after user uploads confirmation). Added # Challenge heading to output format, two new tone rules (no iterating narration, no parenthetical editorializing), extracted auto-crop into a reusable script at scripts/auto_crop.py, and specified base64 image embedding for PDF generation. Applied final pickmi.md tone edits and regenerated the PDF.
- **career-search**: Made the plan actionable day-by-day — added Friday/Saturday/Sunday description paragraphs matching the Mon-Tue and Wed-Thu format, added emojis to all non-phase plan file headings, minor wording tweaks to schedule table.
- **macros**: Added CLAUDE.md with AHK v2 architecture overview and patterns so AI agents can work with the codebase effectively.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Wrote two revision club peer review letters (Corinne's and Isabelle's Unit 2 rough drafts on "Benito Cereno"), created engw3309 skill for Advanced Writing assignments, restructured MetaCTF skill into 4-phase workflow with tone rules and auto-crop extraction. Wrote week 6 CY2550 discussion reply on deepfake engagement, optimized draft-and-revise for token efficiency, extended literal-over-poetic tone rules to textual descriptions, added factual verification phase.
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Built AI agent dev infrastructure — set up ESLint + Prettier with PostToolUse auto-lint hooks, created 22 seed tests for notion skill, built specialized subagents, enhanced CLAUDE.md with architecture docs and token optimization guidelines.
- **claude-global**: Version-controlled the global ~/.claude config — initialized git repo, scanned for and excluded secrets (Anthropic API key in config.json, Canvas API token in .mcp.json), rewrote git history to scrub leaked keys, pushed to GitHub. Added pre-commit secret scanning rule to global CLAUDE.md. Reorganized commands by scope — moved homework-formatting to ds2500 repo, moved update-tone-style-guidelines to global. Updated /update-skill to propose extracting generated code into scripts/ folders.
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Hardened Kalshi weather bot models and operations — made 5 model improvements to reduce risk and sharpen edges (236 tests passing), added scheduled settlement checks with Telegram alerts, raised daily budget to $10, slowed scan interval to 60min, updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive system docs.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Consolidated CS3200 into the university monorepo — merged the standalone cs3200 repo as a subfolder, created a cs3200 skill for the course, cleaned up merged artifacts, added hw3 ER diagram assignment files.

02/11/26 (last checked 02:44):
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Pivoted the weather trading bot from Polymarket (blocked in US) to Kalshi (CFTC-regulated, US-legal) — researched Kalshi API auth (RSA-PSS signing), rewrote all 6 skill files (client.js, markets.js, forecast.js, trade.js, analyze.js, index.js) for Kalshi's event ticker format and structured market data, removed Open-Meteo and expanded from 7 cities to 9 US cities all using NOAA. Set up Kalshi API credentials (API key + RSA private key PEM, both gitignored). Ran successful end-to-end test: 9 cities forecasted, 18 events scanned, 108 markets with live bid/ask prices, 11 trading opportunities detected with >=15% edge (best: Chicago tomorrow <=38F at +72% edge). Updated SKILL.md and created test-kalshi.js script. Committed with 81 behavior tests. Documented credential locations in project CLAUDE.md so other Claude instances can find them.
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Standardized all price and budget units to cents (Kalshi API native format) — refactored analyze.js, trade.js, and forecast.js with extracted helper functions (scoreMarket, validateTradeInputs, calculateContractCount) and separated config/budget into dedicated modules. Added real-money integration tests.
- **slash commands**: Added explicit approval gate to `/update-skill` — it must now stop and wait for user confirmation before editing any files.
- **global CLAUDE.md**: Added "Secrets & Credentials" rule requiring automatic gitignore verification when creating credential files.
- **claude agents**: Built reusable subagent infrastructure for faster parallel task execution — created 4 agent definitions in ~/.claude/agents/: research-explorer (haiku, codebase/doc exploration), code-implementer (sonnet, code writing), test-runner (haiku, test execution), and web-researcher (haiku, web search/summarization).
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Completed the polymarket→kalshi rename across the entire codebase — git mv'd the skill folder and docs file, removed the old test script, updated all import paths and internal references (spend file, SKILL.md name, settings permissions, doc code paths). Created 5 specialized trading agent definitions (researcher, experimenter, market-maker, arbitrage scanner, risk manager) with strategy-specific instructions (Avellaneda-Stoikov spreads, fractional Kelly sizing, circuit breakers, bucket overround scanning). Added experiments tracking folder for strategy optimization trials. All 82 tests pass.
- **claude agents**: Optimized all 4 subagent definitions based on best-practices research — added Definition of Done exit criteria, structured output formats, numbered workflows, and negative constraints to every agent; dropped Bash from research-explorer (~2k fewer init tokens), added memory:user for cross-session learning, reduced maxTurns across all agents, added fetch caps and auto-detection fallbacks.
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Got the Kalshi weather bot running autonomously with Telegram alerts — built scanner loop (scanner.js, usage.js, settlement.js, trading-config.json) with 4 trading modes and 21 new tests (103 total passing). Debugged why the bot couldn't run skills in Telegram — discovered clawdbot's embedded agent has no exec tool, so skills are documentation-only. Solved by creating a standalone cron script (scripts/kalshi-cron.js) that bypasses the LLM and calls scanner functions directly, sends results via Telegram bot API. Set up 3 Windows Task Scheduler jobs (30-min scan, 10-min usage alert, 9PM daily summary). Verified scan results arriving on phone: 8 opportunities across 9 cities, best edge +69pp Chicago.
- **claude skills**: Created openclaw skill documenting the hard-won clawdbot architecture knowledge (skills are docs not code, no exec tool, cron can't run scripts, standalone script workaround pattern). Updated debug skill with "read the error output first" and "start with simplest explanation" steps. Added "never hardcode tokens in scripts" to global CLAUDE.md.
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Got the Kalshi bot trading autonomously and deployed to Oracle Cloud — added GFS ensemble forecasting, Kelly sizing, and circuit breakers; Dockerized the full stack (gateway + kalshi-trader + assistant) for 24/7 $0/month hosting on Oracle Cloud Free Tier. Debugged Docker OOM crashes (increased heap limits, reduced container memory), fixed gateway startup (added 'run' subcommand for foreground mode), switched from named volumes to bind mounts for config persistence, mounted Google service account and PEM key into containers. Updated openclaw, debug, and docker skills based on lessons from the deployment session.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Fixed 5 custom skills that were invisible to Claude Code — discovered that auto-discovery requires YAML frontmatter (name + description in --- delimiters) and all 5 skills (meta_ctf, breakup_big_pdf, cy2550_discussion, bloggy, write_academic) were missing it. Created a create_update_skill reference skill documenting the required format, moved it to ~/.claude/skills/ so it's available across all projects.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Solved MetaCTF 4 "spamtoham" challenge — bypassed Comcast safebrowse.io proxy blocking the challenge URL via Playwright, decoded a base64 PNG attachment from a raw MIME email to extract the flag. Discovered that Google/Bing/DuckDuckGo/Brave/Startpage all CAPTCHA headless browsers and Yahoo is the only search engine that works. Updated meta_ctf skill to use Yahoo searches and backtick filename references for screenshots. Created 3 reusable Playwright scripts in agent-browser skill (Yahoo search, content rendering, file viewing).

02/10/26 (last checked 00:26):
- **rec-system-folder**: Completed the tracer bullet end-to-end — tested the popularity model, built a FastAPI `/recommend` endpoint proving backend-to-model pipeline works, added a frontend scaffold with a button that fetches the API and displays a recommendation. Fixed numpy.int64 JSON serialization along the way. Reorganized project structure per demo guidelines — separated model logic into src/ and serving layer into app/, added CORS middleware, fixed stale uvicorn process blocking port 8000.
- **macros**: Hardened commit macro against false triggers — reset press count when any non-p key is pressed between p-presses (using `A_PriorKey`), preventing words like "poppy" or "app password" from firing it.
- **slash commands**: Improved professor-mode to treat imperative requests as teaching moments (concepts + function lists, not step-by-step solutions). Improved update-skill to scan for user prompts describing desired behaviors/formats as potential skill gaps to propose fixing.
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Rebranded from Clawdbot to OpenClaw and gave the agent full GitHub capabilities — built a complete Octokit-based GitHub skill (17 functions: repos, issues, PRs, files, branches) with confirmation workflows for destructive ops. Moved and renamed the master plan to `openclaw-master-plan.md`, expanded it from 346 to 900+ lines by synthesizing 20+ community sources (security hardening, cost control strategies for 77% reduction, heartbeat/automation patterns, multi-agent swarm architecture, common mistakes, deployment hardening). Researched 9 X posts on money-making strategies and synthesized them into actionable build plans: Polymarket weather bots (95% win rate), crypto wallet copy-trading, Fiverr/Upwork freelance arbitrage, and UGC TikTok Shop content generation.
- **career-search**: Added 02/10 daily log and moved Phase 2 links/notes into plan.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Polished and finalized the Unit 2 rough draft (essay prospectus on "the negro" in Melville's "Benito Cereno") — applied skeptical professor suggestions, ran parallel tone review with 4 subagents, inserted real page numbers from source PDFs (Faherty, Havard, Jones). Generated submission-ready PDF with MLA formatting.
- **skills**: Created markdown-to-pdf skill with Python script (block quotes, dynamic metadata, Skia/PDF producer for Google Docs appearance). Improved draft-and-revise with parallel tone review phase (Phase 5), auto page-number extraction from source PDFs scoped to Works Cited assignments, placeholder verification before saving, and submission instructions step. Added "check existing tools first" to global CLAUDE.md.

02/09/26 (last checked 02:19):
- **google-sheets-mcp-server**: Enabled Claude Code to directly read and write Google Spreadsheets without manual download/upload — built a TypeScript MCP server with 10 tools (get/update/append/clear values, spreadsheet info, create/add/delete sheets), configured service account auth, and registered it in .mcp.json.
- **rec-system-folder**: Started building the Goodbooks-10K data pipeline — added a dataset loading script using pandas, loaded all CSVs (ratings, book_tags, to_read, tags), switched from remote URLs to local files for faster iteration. Designed a tracer bullet approach for an end-to-end popularity baseline — wrote the tracer plan in tracer.md and built the untested popularity model in main.py, resolved open questions about the approach.
- **career-search**: Added Instagram Stories as a posting platform in plan.md, started the metalearning worksheet with a date, and added npm build permissions to Claude settings.
- **macros**: Increased commit-and-push macro from 3 to 4 presses to prevent accidental triggers. Diagnosed and fixed phantom key repeat bug — OS auto-repeat was inflating press counts through AHK's `~` passthrough modifier; added `KeyWait` to suppress it.
- **slash commands**: Created `/debug` skill with systematic debugging methodology — believe the user first, search for known platform issues before theorizing, instrument the exact failure condition, never present speculation as confirmed root cause.
- **slash commands**: Created `/delegate` command for handing off stuck problems to another LLM with full context (code, errors, what's been tried), and created `tracer-bullet` skill for building the simplest end-to-end system version before optimizing any single component.
- **career-search**: Fixed recurring Windows `nul` file bug — `/dev/null` redirection creates a literal file on Windows; added `nul` to a new global `.gitignore_global` so git ignores it across all repos.

02/08/26 (last checked 01:23):
- **macros**: Added Comet window focusing to website hotkeys and switched tab switching to use RShift modifier.
- **slash commands**: Created `/update-skill` command that reviews session corrections and bakes them into skill prompts, including capturing verification prompts as signals for missing validation steps. Refined it to list identified skills/commands first for confirmation, and to distinguish between skills and commands that may live in different directories. Updated `/what-i-did-today` to use a `scan-repos.sh` script (bypassing Claude Code's shell-operator permission limitation), added last-checked timestamps to avoid re-fetching old commits, and made bullet descriptions more detailed for repos with many changes.
- **rec-system-folder**: Connected repo to GitHub remote, pushed initial commit, and created an AHK script for RShift+Arrow browser tab reordering in Comet.
- **career-search**: In plan.md clarified that phase 1 is about coding myself and understanding it, and phase 2 is about building with agents.Restructured plan.md from 6 phases to 5 — merged old Phases 1+2 into a single "build + ship rec sys" Phase 1 (Feb-Apr), merged old Phase 3 + project-2 scoping into Phase 2 (May-Jul), renumbered remaining phases. Added emojis to all phase headings and day-of-week headings, converted day-of-week headings to h4, fixed duplicate HackerRank in Friday headers, added HackerRank/SQL/open-source/mock-interview content from metalearning gap analysis.
- **slash commands**: Ensured daily logs and commit messages communicate impact first — updated `/what-i-did-today` skill and global `CLAUDE.md` to lead with the significant purpose ("why") before listing mechanical tasks, with good/bad examples in both files.

02/07/26:
- **yc_application**: Built the full YC application from scratch — initial draft, refined answers, added Sidequest details, wrote a pitch script with market stats and role assignments.
- **rec-system-folder**: Initialized the repo with a recommendation.md technical plan and .gitignore.
- **career-search**: Reorganized files into ultralearning folder and updated Phase 1-2 project plans with concrete rec sys tasks (Goodreads-10K, Two-Tower model, FastAPI demo, etc.).
- **macros**: Modularized AutoHotkey scripts into separate files with a main.ahk launcher, extracted the Explorer hotkey into its own script, built a triple-p "commit and push" macro and triple-l "git pull origin main" macro, moved scripts into a scripts/ subfolder, and configured Claude Code permissions for auto-allowed commands.
- **slash commands**: Updated /what-i-did-today to output one bullet per repo instead of a single sentence, check for existing date sections before adding duplicates, and insert newest entries at the top.
- **lunar-lander-file-folder**: Wrote the entire project README, then fixed GitHub display — discovered GitHub's blob viewer doesn't render MP4 files, uploaded the training video as an issue attachment for inline playback, moved the README to the repo root so GitHub displays it, and cleaned up loose files (removed duplicate video, moved sweep log to logs/, deleted empty test1.py).
- **macros**: Added Shift+Arrow Comet browser tab switching, text expansion hotstrings, smart copy, #SingleInstance Force, faster Explorer navigation, renamed notion-hotkeys to website-hotkeys with Win+6 for GitHub repos.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Edited Project 5 VSD analysis with anti-AI-detection tone guidelines. Solved MetaCTF 3 challenges (Barry's Web Application directory traversal, Back to the Future User-Agent/cookie bypass) with runnable scripts and writeups; updated meta_ctf skill with tone enforcement section, script workflow rules, backtick ban, and logical completeness verification; added 3 new tone guidelines (discovery order, no technical justifications, broadened First/Second/Third rule); updated /update-tone-style-guidelines command to require completing all identified patterns; created ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md to disable co-author in commits.
