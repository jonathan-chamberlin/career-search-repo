Referenced the claude slash command /what-i-did-today

- **google-sheets-mcp-server**: Enabled Claude Code to directly read and write Google Spreadsheets without manual download/upload — built a TypeScript MCP server with 10 tools (get/update/append/clear values, spreadsheet info, create/add/delete sheets), configured service account auth, and registered it in .mcp.json.
- **rec-system-folder**: Started building the Goodbooks-10K data pipeline — added a dataset loading script using pandas, loaded all CSVs (ratings, book_tags, to_read, tags), switched from remote URLs to local files for faster iteration. Designed a tracer bullet approach for an end-to-end popularity baseline — wrote the tracer plan in tracer.md and built the untested popularity model in main.py, resolved open questions about the approach.
- **career-search**: Added Instagram Stories as a posting platform in plan.md, started the metalearning worksheet with a date, and added npm build permissions to Claude settings.
- **macros**: Increased commit-and-push macro from 3 to 4 presses to prevent accidental triggers. Diagnosed and fixed phantom key repeat bug — OS auto-repeat was inflating press counts through AHK's `~` passthrough modifier; added `KeyWait` to suppress it.
- **slash commands**: Created `/debug` skill with systematic debugging methodology — believe the user first, search for known platform issues before theorizing, instrument the exact failure condition, never present speculation as confirmed root cause.
- **slash commands**: Created `/delegate` command for handing off stuck problems to another LLM with full context (code, errors, what's been tried), and created `tracer-bullet` skill for building the simplest end-to-end system version before optimizing any single component.
- **career-search**: Fixed recurring Windows `nul` file bug — `/dev/null` redirection creates a literal file on Windows; added `nul` to a new global `.gitignore_global` so git ignores it across all repos.

- **macros**: Added Comet window focusing to website hotkeys and switched tab switching to use RShift modifier.
- **slash commands**: Created `/update-skill` command that reviews session corrections and bakes them into skill prompts, including capturing verification prompts as signals for missing validation steps. Refined it to list identified skills/commands first for confirmation, and to distinguish between skills and commands that may live in different directories. Updated `/what-i-did-today` to use a `scan-repos.sh` script (bypassing Claude Code's shell-operator permission limitation), added last-checked timestamps to avoid re-fetching old commits, and made bullet descriptions more detailed for repos with many changes.
- **rec-system-folder**: Connected repo to GitHub remote, pushed initial commit, and created an AHK script for RShift+Arrow browser tab reordering in Comet.
- **career-search**: In plan.md clarified that phase 1 is about coding myself and understanding it, and phase 2 is about building with agents.Restructured plan.md from 6 phases to 5 — merged old Phases 1+2 into a single "build + ship rec sys" Phase 1 (Feb-Apr), merged old Phase 3 + project-2 scoping into Phase 2 (May-Jul), renumbered remaining phases. Added emojis to all phase headings and day-of-week headings, converted day-of-week headings to h4, fixed duplicate HackerRank in Friday headers, added HackerRank/SQL/open-source/mock-interview content from metalearning gap analysis.
- **slash commands**: Ensured daily logs and commit messages communicate impact first — updated `/what-i-did-today` skill and global `CLAUDE.md` to lead with the significant purpose ("why") before listing mechanical tasks, with good/bad examples in both files.

02/07/26:
- **yc_application**: Built the full YC application from scratch — initial draft, refined answers, added Sidequest details, wrote a pitch script with market stats and role assignments.
- **rec-system-folder**: Initialized the repo with a recommendation.md technical plan and .gitignore.
- **career-search**: Reorganized files into ultralearning folder and updated Phase 1-2 project plans with concrete rec sys tasks (Goodreads-10K, Two-Tower model, FastAPI demo, etc.).
- **macros**: Modularized AutoHotkey scripts into separate files with a main.ahk launcher, extracted the Explorer hotkey into its own script, built a triple-p "commit and push" macro and triple-l "git pull origin main" macro, moved scripts into a scripts/ subfolder, and configured Claude Code permissions for auto-allowed commands.
- **slash commands**: Updated /what-i-did-today to output one bullet per repo instead of a single sentence, check for existing date sections before adding duplicates, and insert newest entries at the top.
- **lunar-lander-file-folder**: Wrote the entire project README, then fixed GitHub display — discovered GitHub's blob viewer doesn't render MP4 files, uploaded the training video as an issue attachment for inline playback, moved the README to the repo root so GitHub displays it, and cleaned up loose files (removed duplicate video, moved sweep log to logs/, deleted empty test1.py).
- **macros**: Added Shift+Arrow Comet browser tab switching, text expansion hotstrings, smart copy, #SingleInstance Force, faster Explorer navigation, renamed notion-hotkeys to website-hotkeys with Win+6 for GitHub repos.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Edited Project 5 VSD analysis with anti-AI-detection tone guidelines. Solved MetaCTF 3 challenges (Barry's Web Application directory traversal, Back to the Future User-Agent/cookie bypass) with runnable scripts and writeups; updated meta_ctf skill with tone enforcement section, script workflow rules, backtick ban, and logical completeness verification; added 3 new tone guidelines (discovery order, no technical justifications, broadened First/Second/Third rule); updated /update-tone-style-guidelines command to require completing all identified patterns; created ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md to disable co-author in commits.
