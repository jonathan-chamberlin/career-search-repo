# What I Did Today
Referenced the claude slash command /what-i-did-today

02/07/26:
- **yc_application**: Built the full YC application from scratch — initial draft, refined answers, added Sidequest details, wrote a pitch script with market stats and role assignments.
- **rec-system-folder**: Initialized the repo with a recommendation.md technical plan and .gitignore.
- **career-search**: Reorganized files into ultralearning folder and updated Phase 1-2 project plans with concrete rec sys tasks (Goodreads-10K, Two-Tower model, FastAPI demo, etc.).
- **slash commands**: Updated /what-i-did-today to output one bullet per repo instead of a single sentence, check for existing date sections before adding duplicates, and insert newest entries at the top.
- **lunar-lander-file-folder**: Wrote the entire project README, then fixed GitHub display — discovered GitHub's blob viewer doesn't render MP4 files, uploaded the training video as an issue attachment for inline playback, moved the README to the repo root so GitHub displays it, and cleaned up loose files (removed duplicate video, moved sweep log to logs/, deleted empty test1.py).
