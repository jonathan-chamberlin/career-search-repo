- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Pivoted the weather trading bot from Polymarket (blocked in US) to Kalshi (CFTC-regulated, US-legal) — researched Kalshi API auth (RSA-PSS signing), rewrote all 6 skill files (client.js, markets.js, forecast.js, trade.js, analyze.js, index.js) for Kalshi's event ticker format and structured market data, removed Open-Meteo and expanded from 7 cities to 9 US cities all using NOAA. Set up Kalshi API credentials (API key + RSA private key PEM, both gitignored). Ran successful end-to-end test: 9 cities forecasted, 18 events scanned, 108 markets with live bid/ask prices, 11 trading opportunities detected with >=15% edge (best: Chicago tomorrow <=38F at +72% edge). Updated SKILL.md and created test-kalshi.js script. Committed with 81 behavior tests. Documented credential locations in project CLAUDE.md so other Claude instances can find them.
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Standardized all price and budget units to cents (Kalshi API native format) — refactored analyze.js, trade.js, and forecast.js with extracted helper functions (scoreMarket, validateTradeInputs, calculateContractCount) and separated config/budget into dedicated modules. Added real-money integration tests.
- **slash commands**: Added explicit approval gate to `/update-skill` — it must now stop and wait for user confirmation before editing any files.
- **global CLAUDE.md**: Added "Secrets & Credentials" rule requiring automatic gitignore verification when creating credential files.
- **claude agents**: Built reusable subagent infrastructure for faster parallel task execution — created 4 agent definitions in ~/.claude/agents/: research-explorer (haiku, codebase/doc exploration), code-implementer (sonnet, code writing), test-runner (haiku, test execution), and web-researcher (haiku, web search/summarization).
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Completed the polymarket→kalshi rename across the entire codebase — git mv'd the skill folder and docs file, removed the old test script, updated all import paths and internal references (spend file, SKILL.md name, settings permissions, doc code paths). Created 5 specialized trading agent definitions (researcher, experimenter, market-maker, arbitrage scanner, risk manager) with strategy-specific instructions (Avellaneda-Stoikov spreads, fractional Kelly sizing, circuit breakers, bucket overround scanning). Added experiments tracking folder for strategy optimization trials. All 82 tests pass.
- **claude agents**: Optimized all 4 subagent definitions based on best-practices research — added Definition of Done exit criteria, structured output formats, numbered workflows, and negative constraints to every agent; dropped Bash from research-explorer (~2k fewer init tokens), added memory:user for cross-session learning, reduced maxTurns across all agents, added fetch caps and auto-detection fallbacks.
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Got the Kalshi weather bot running autonomously with Telegram alerts — built scanner loop (scanner.js, usage.js, settlement.js, trading-config.json) with 4 trading modes and 21 new tests (103 total passing). Debugged why the bot couldn't run skills in Telegram — discovered clawdbot's embedded agent has no exec tool, so skills are documentation-only. Solved by creating a standalone cron script (scripts/kalshi-cron.js) that bypasses the LLM and calls scanner functions directly, sends results via Telegram bot API. Set up 3 Windows Task Scheduler jobs (30-min scan, 10-min usage alert, 9PM daily summary). Verified scan results arriving on phone: 8 opportunities across 9 cities, best edge +69pp Chicago.
- **claude skills**: Created openclaw skill documenting the hard-won clawdbot architecture knowledge (skills are docs not code, no exec tool, cron can't run scripts, standalone script workaround pattern). Updated debug skill with "read the error output first" and "start with simplest explanation" steps. Added "never hardcode tokens in scripts" to global CLAUDE.md.
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Got the Kalshi bot trading autonomously and deployed to Oracle Cloud — added GFS ensemble forecasting, Kelly sizing, and circuit breakers; Dockerized the full stack (gateway + kalshi-trader + assistant) for 24/7 $0/month hosting on Oracle Cloud Free Tier. Debugged Docker OOM crashes (increased heap limits, reduced container memory), fixed gateway startup (added 'run' subcommand for foreground mode), switched from named volumes to bind mounts for config persistence, mounted Google service account and PEM key into containers. Updated openclaw, debug, and docker skills based on lessons from the deployment session.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Fixed 5 custom skills that were invisible to Claude Code — discovered that auto-discovery requires YAML frontmatter (name + description in --- delimiters) and all 5 skills (meta_ctf, breakup_big_pdf, cy2550_discussion, bloggy, write_academic) were missing it. Created a create_update_skill reference skill documenting the required format, moved it to ~/.claude/skills/ so it's available across all projects.

02/10/26 (last checked 00:26):
- **rec-system-folder**: Completed the tracer bullet end-to-end — tested the popularity model, built a FastAPI `/recommend` endpoint proving backend-to-model pipeline works, added a frontend scaffold with a button that fetches the API and displays a recommendation. Fixed numpy.int64 JSON serialization along the way. Reorganized project structure per demo guidelines — separated model logic into src/ and serving layer into app/, added CORS middleware, fixed stale uvicorn process blocking port 8000.
- **macros**: Hardened commit macro against false triggers — reset press count when any non-p key is pressed between p-presses (using `A_PriorKey`), preventing words like "poppy" or "app password" from firing it.
- **slash commands**: Improved professor-mode to treat imperative requests as teaching moments (concepts + function lists, not step-by-step solutions). Improved update-skill to scan for user prompts describing desired behaviors/formats as potential skill gaps to propose fixing.
- **notion-executive-assistant-folder**: Rebranded from Clawdbot to OpenClaw and gave the agent full GitHub capabilities — built a complete Octokit-based GitHub skill (17 functions: repos, issues, PRs, files, branches) with confirmation workflows for destructive ops. Moved and renamed the master plan to `openclaw-master-plan.md`, expanded it from 346 to 900+ lines by synthesizing 20+ community sources (security hardening, cost control strategies for 77% reduction, heartbeat/automation patterns, multi-agent swarm architecture, common mistakes, deployment hardening). Researched 9 X posts on money-making strategies and synthesized them into actionable build plans: Polymarket weather bots (95% win rate), crypto wallet copy-trading, Fiverr/Upwork freelance arbitrage, and UGC TikTok Shop content generation.
- **career-search**: Added 02/10 daily log and moved Phase 2 links/notes into plan.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Polished and finalized the Unit 2 rough draft (essay prospectus on "the negro" in Melville's "Benito Cereno") — applied skeptical professor suggestions, ran parallel tone review with 4 subagents, inserted real page numbers from source PDFs (Faherty, Havard, Jones). Generated submission-ready PDF with MLA formatting.
- **skills**: Created markdown-to-pdf skill with Python script (block quotes, dynamic metadata, Skia/PDF producer for Google Docs appearance). Improved draft-and-revise with parallel tone review phase (Phase 5), auto page-number extraction from source PDFs scoped to Works Cited assignments, placeholder verification before saving, and submission instructions step. Added "check existing tools first" to global CLAUDE.md.

02/09/26 (last checked 02:19):
- **google-sheets-mcp-server**: Enabled Claude Code to directly read and write Google Spreadsheets without manual download/upload — built a TypeScript MCP server with 10 tools (get/update/append/clear values, spreadsheet info, create/add/delete sheets), configured service account auth, and registered it in .mcp.json.
- **rec-system-folder**: Started building the Goodbooks-10K data pipeline — added a dataset loading script using pandas, loaded all CSVs (ratings, book_tags, to_read, tags), switched from remote URLs to local files for faster iteration. Designed a tracer bullet approach for an end-to-end popularity baseline — wrote the tracer plan in tracer.md and built the untested popularity model in main.py, resolved open questions about the approach.
- **career-search**: Added Instagram Stories as a posting platform in plan.md, started the metalearning worksheet with a date, and added npm build permissions to Claude settings.
- **macros**: Increased commit-and-push macro from 3 to 4 presses to prevent accidental triggers. Diagnosed and fixed phantom key repeat bug — OS auto-repeat was inflating press counts through AHK's `~` passthrough modifier; added `KeyWait` to suppress it.
- **slash commands**: Created `/debug` skill with systematic debugging methodology — believe the user first, search for known platform issues before theorizing, instrument the exact failure condition, never present speculation as confirmed root cause.
- **slash commands**: Created `/delegate` command for handing off stuck problems to another LLM with full context (code, errors, what's been tried), and created `tracer-bullet` skill for building the simplest end-to-end system version before optimizing any single component.
- **career-search**: Fixed recurring Windows `nul` file bug — `/dev/null` redirection creates a literal file on Windows; added `nul` to a new global `.gitignore_global` so git ignores it across all repos.

02/08/26 (last checked 01:23):
- **macros**: Added Comet window focusing to website hotkeys and switched tab switching to use RShift modifier.
- **slash commands**: Created `/update-skill` command that reviews session corrections and bakes them into skill prompts, including capturing verification prompts as signals for missing validation steps. Refined it to list identified skills/commands first for confirmation, and to distinguish between skills and commands that may live in different directories. Updated `/what-i-did-today` to use a `scan-repos.sh` script (bypassing Claude Code's shell-operator permission limitation), added last-checked timestamps to avoid re-fetching old commits, and made bullet descriptions more detailed for repos with many changes.
- **rec-system-folder**: Connected repo to GitHub remote, pushed initial commit, and created an AHK script for RShift+Arrow browser tab reordering in Comet.
- **career-search**: In plan.md clarified that phase 1 is about coding myself and understanding it, and phase 2 is about building with agents.Restructured plan.md from 6 phases to 5 — merged old Phases 1+2 into a single "build + ship rec sys" Phase 1 (Feb-Apr), merged old Phase 3 + project-2 scoping into Phase 2 (May-Jul), renumbered remaining phases. Added emojis to all phase headings and day-of-week headings, converted day-of-week headings to h4, fixed duplicate HackerRank in Friday headers, added HackerRank/SQL/open-source/mock-interview content from metalearning gap analysis.
- **slash commands**: Ensured daily logs and commit messages communicate impact first — updated `/what-i-did-today` skill and global `CLAUDE.md` to lead with the significant purpose ("why") before listing mechanical tasks, with good/bad examples in both files.

02/07/26:
- **yc_application**: Built the full YC application from scratch — initial draft, refined answers, added Sidequest details, wrote a pitch script with market stats and role assignments.
- **rec-system-folder**: Initialized the repo with a recommendation.md technical plan and .gitignore.
- **career-search**: Reorganized files into ultralearning folder and updated Phase 1-2 project plans with concrete rec sys tasks (Goodreads-10K, Two-Tower model, FastAPI demo, etc.).
- **macros**: Modularized AutoHotkey scripts into separate files with a main.ahk launcher, extracted the Explorer hotkey into its own script, built a triple-p "commit and push" macro and triple-l "git pull origin main" macro, moved scripts into a scripts/ subfolder, and configured Claude Code permissions for auto-allowed commands.
- **slash commands**: Updated /what-i-did-today to output one bullet per repo instead of a single sentence, check for existing date sections before adding duplicates, and insert newest entries at the top.
- **lunar-lander-file-folder**: Wrote the entire project README, then fixed GitHub display — discovered GitHub's blob viewer doesn't render MP4 files, uploaded the training video as an issue attachment for inline playback, moved the README to the repo root so GitHub displays it, and cleaned up loose files (removed duplicate video, moved sweep log to logs/, deleted empty test1.py).
- **macros**: Added Shift+Arrow Comet browser tab switching, text expansion hotstrings, smart copy, #SingleInstance Force, faster Explorer navigation, renamed notion-hotkeys to website-hotkeys with Win+6 for GitHub repos.
- **northeastern_university_folder**: Edited Project 5 VSD analysis with anti-AI-detection tone guidelines. Solved MetaCTF 3 challenges (Barry's Web Application directory traversal, Back to the Future User-Agent/cookie bypass) with runnable scripts and writeups; updated meta_ctf skill with tone enforcement section, script workflow rules, backtick ban, and logical completeness verification; added 3 new tone guidelines (discovery order, no technical justifications, broadened First/Second/Third rule); updated /update-tone-style-guidelines command to require completing all identified patterns; created ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md to disable co-author in commits.
